//When DOM Content is loaded fetch characters from the Witcher Api

//Render a list on the left side of the screen of the first 30 characters
//Render back and next buttons to scroll through pages of characters at the bottom of the list

//add an event listener to each li, when the li is clicked then the information about that character is rendered to the page in a section

//add an event listener for them to like that character
    //liking it saves it to a section at the bottom of the screen titled 'Favorite Characters'
        //characters are put in a container with a thumbnail and their name.
        //they display horizontally in boxes when the boxes fill the screen horizontally they make a new row
            //could I put a slider for this part?

//create a hidden form that has a button filter characters
    //when you click this button a form appears with:
        //a dropdown list of character traits to search within
            //options: name, gender, race, profession, nationality, appearance
        //text input where they can type in text and search for that attribute name
